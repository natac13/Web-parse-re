## Web Parser from D3 fan site

### By: Natac

This is simply my first successful attempt at parsing a website using python!
This script, although small aloud me to explore the urllib.request and regular
expression (re) modules in python.

The program just simple goes to a site I visit, and prints out all the topics 
that are current. This allows me to not have to visit the website unless I see 
something of interest!! Save me a bit of time. 

*I tried to change this to a more practical program to do the same thing with
the [zerohedge.com](http://www.zerohedge.com/) website. However, the request 
returns something that is not html... I am not really sure of what it is, as I 
am still very new to this! My first guess is that it is someting to do with 
Ascii and UTF-8 but I am not sure where to even start. **ANY** help would be 
very welcome for this!*
